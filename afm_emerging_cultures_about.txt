[b]A few more Emerging Culture Names[/b] is a simple mod that adds a few predefined culture names for hybridization.

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] The [b]Cossacks[/b] hybridize from any [b]East Slavic[/b] and any [b]Turkic[/b] culture.
[*] The [b]Gascons[/b] hybridize from [b]Basque[/b] and any [b]Frankish[/b] culture in [b]Aquitaine[/b].

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This mod simply adds a few things, it should be [b]compatible with almost all mods[/b]. It will naturally conflict with other mods that offer the same features, but nothing would be game breaking.
